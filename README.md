In this project, I use neural networks to understand the phases of a spin system (see Ref.). In particular, my goal is twofold: 
* (i) Identify whether a spin configuration is hot (paramagnetic phase) or cold (ferromagnetic phase)
* (ii) Estimate the critical transition point of the phase transition.

The spin system is described by a toy model, known as ["Ising model"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model), which is used to understand the temperature behaviour of a magnet. Here, the spins have 2 states: up or down. At low temperatures, spins point in only one direction, leading to the ferromagnetic phase with a net magnetic moment. Increasing the temperature leads to thermal fluctuation, and at one point, the magnetism is lost -- i.e. paramagnet state with an almost equal number of up and down spin appears.

`01_generateData.ipynb` -- Builds the Ising model on a square lattice, and generates the datasets.

`02_ising_neural_net.ipynb` -- NN models are trained, and validated using the generated datasets.

Run `pip install pip install requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
